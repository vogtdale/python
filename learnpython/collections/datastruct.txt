What is a Data Structure?

Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient 
modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data 
in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, 
relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. 


Types of Data Structures in Python

Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable 
you to store and access data. These structures are called

Dictionary, 
Tuple and 
Set.
