# Write a password generator in Python. 
# Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords
# have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, 
# numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be 
# random, generating a new password every time 
# the user asks for a new password. 
# Include your run-time code in a main method.
