# Take two lists, say for example these two:
# a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

c = set(a) & set(b) # calculates th intersection
b = set(a).intersection(b) # gain spped
d = []
# procedural 
for items in a:
    for elemnts in b:
        if items == elemnts:
            if items in d:
                None
            else: 
                d.append(items)
print(d)
