# Create a program that asks the user 
# for a number and then prints out a list of 
# all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = int(input("Please choose a number to divide: "))
count = 1

while count <= num:
    if (num % count == 0):
        print(count)
    count = count + 1
